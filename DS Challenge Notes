Question 1:

Step 1: Define the Problem:
"We want to determine if the placement of Brand Z's candy within Client X's stores is related to the sales revenue associated with Brand Z's candy"

Step 2: Define the Hypothesis:
H_0: There is no relationship between the placement of the candy and the sales revenue
H_A: There is a relationship between the placement of the candy and the sales revenue

Step 3: Define the Analysis Criteria
-Specify the significance level: alpha = 0.05
-Select the test statistic: Z/t test comparing sample means
	-Population mean is known
	-Check sample size > 30
-Options:
	-Paired t-test: Compare the results of candy placement within the same store at two time intervalas
		-Benefits:
			-Controls for within sample variation
		-Drawbacks:
			-Requires more time
	-Two sample t-test: Compare the results of a set of stores to another set of stores
		-Benefits:
			-
		-Drawbacks:
			-Difficult to control for natural variation between stores >> mitigated via sampling plan.
