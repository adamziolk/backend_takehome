Question 1:
Assumption: 
-Initial meeting to explain what the test will look like.  
-It is conceptual, the data collection hasn't been performed yet
-Test period was 91 days (Sun - Sun), pre period was 90 days (Sun - Sat)

Needed from client:
-Timeline -> Paired vs independent tests
-Estimated effect size -> Dictates power/sample size
-


Step 1: Define the Problem:
"We want to determine if the placement of Brand Z's candy within Client X's stores is related to the sales revenue associated with Brand Z's candy"

Step 2: Define the Hypothesis:
H_0: There is no relationship between the placement of the candy and the sales revenue
H_A: There is a relationship between the placement of the candy and the sales revenue

Step 3: Define the Analysis Criteria
-Specify the significance level: alpha = 0.05
	-Probability of Type I error:
		-i.e. Reality is true (there is no realtionship) - test is false (we detect one anyway)
-Select the test statistic: Z/t test comparing sample means
	-Population mean is known
	-Check sample size > 30
-Options:
	-Paired t-test: Compare the results of candy placement within the same store at two time intervalas
		-Benefits:
			-Controls for within sample variation
		-Drawbacks:
			-Requires more time
	-Two sample t-test: Compare the results of a set of stores to another set of stores
		-Benefits:
			-Faster
		-Drawbacks:
			-Difficult to control for natural variation between stores >> mitigated via sampling plan.

Step 4: Define the Data Collection Plan
-Define the power: (1-beta) = 0.8
	-Beta is probability of Type II error:
		i.e. Reality is false (there is relationship) - test is true (we don't notice it)
	-(1-Beta) inverts it: Power: Probability of finding a relationship when it exists
-Calculate the sample size based on the power and estimated effect size.
-Recommendation:
	-Estimated effect size: 3%
	-Standard Deviation: 10% of mean value
	-Alpha = 0.05
	-Power = 0.8
	-Sample size should be ~175 samples
-Based on Q3: Independent test
	-Define the number of treatment groups (i.e. placement 1 vs placement 2 vs placement 3...)
	-Define which stores will go into the treatment vs control
		-Define a sampling plan: See Q2
	-Define a timeline
		-Based on Q3: 90 day prior
		-Implementation: 28 days
		-91 days post




Step 5: Collect the Data
-Record the transactions in a suitable format
-Must capture:
	-Candy related sales
		-Price (assuming uniform currency)
		-Quanity
	-By Date
	-By Store



Step 6: Analyze the Data
-Compare the differences in sales
	-Examine variation within groups:
		-I.e. in treatment/control group, how much do sales fluctuate normally.
	-Examine variation between groups:
		-I.e. how different is treatment group compared to control group
	-Compare results before and after experiment

Step 7: Conclusion
-Calculate how likely it is to observe results this extreme by random chance.
